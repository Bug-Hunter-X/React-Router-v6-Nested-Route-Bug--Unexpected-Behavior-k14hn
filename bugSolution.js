```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />}>
          <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
          <Route path="contact" element={<Contact />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This corrected code uses nested routes correctly. By including the nested routes inside the parent route, correct rendering and navigation is assured.  The `element` prop is also correctly assigned to each route.
